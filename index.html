            I spent 4 years during my bachelor's at <a href="#">WCBN-FM Ann Arbor</a> as a freeform radio DJ, talkshow host, social media manager, 
            and station manager. I learned a huge amount about running the station, managing and collaborating
            in a very diverse environment, organizing schedules, and of course about recording and broadcasting
            technology.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">In addition to managing a freeform radio station, I was the co-founder of a small opera company
            in Berlin, where I produced, stage-managed, and performed several operas. I was also involved in organizing concerts
            and other events.

            <p class="section-text">
                With my knowledge of radio broadcasting and interviewing, I spent several years doing freelance
                voice acting. This included recording for novels, short stories, animations, and other small projects. 
                This usually involved recording, editing, and mastering these small projects.

            become passionate about not just language education, but all kinds of education.
